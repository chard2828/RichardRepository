      <p>A Guidance Council, typically referred to as a Guidance Counsel, is a professional within the education system responsible for providing guidance and support to students, helping them navigate academic, personal, social, and career-related challenges. These professionals often work in schools or educational institutions, offering counseling, advising, and mentoring services to students.

        <p><b>Here are some key points from Republic Act No. 9258:</b></p>
        
        <p><b>Republic Act No. 9258 - Guidance and Counseling Act of 2004:</b> This law serves as a foundational guideline for the professional practice of guidance counseling. It establishes the Board of Guidance and Counseling under the PRC and outlines the qualifications, licensure, standards, and code of ethics for guidance counselors.</p>
        
        <p><b>Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) Guidelines:</b> The PRC, through the Board of Guidance and Counseling, sets the standards, qualifications, and requirements for individuals aspiring to become licensed guidance counselors. This includes the educational qualifications, examinations, and continuing professional development necessary for maintaining a valid counseling license.</p>
        
        <p><b>Guidance and Counseling Services:</b> Institutions are directed to establish guidance and counseling programs aimed at providing academic, career, personal, and social support to students. This involves assisting students in making informed decisions about their academic paths, career choices, personal development, and addressing any challenges they may face during their time in higher education.</p>
        
        <p><b>Code of Ethics:</b> Republic Act No. 9258 outlines a code of ethics for guidance counselors, which includes principles of confidentiality, professionalism, respect for diversity, and the ethical treatment of clients.
